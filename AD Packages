# TODO: Ensure the dns server is also the AD server address

        realm join --user=administrator ${DOMAIN}         # will prompt you for a password currently

# need to ensure that realm is started - needed to reboot in order to allow joining - next attempt be sure to try and restart realmd - check for other services that might not be started (from the list of software installed above)
